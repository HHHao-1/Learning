**Natural History Surveys and Biodiversity（自然史调查与生物多样性）**

Another limitation of this history is that it treats mainly vertebrate zoology and some botany, but insects and other invertebrates hardly at all. This is not an arbitrary limitation: survey collecting in my period, especially by museums, concentrated on vertebrate animals, because scientific fieldwork piggybacked on collecting for exhibits of vertebrate animals.(Insects, plants, and mollusks did not have quite the same potential for eye-catching displays.) In addition, invertebrates are discouragingly numerous for comprehensive survey inventories.and they remained the province of amateur specialists long after vertebrate animals became the objects of organized survey. Invertebrates have recently become the object of systematic inventory, but in ways quite different from earlier surveys.

Like any scientific (or any cultural) practice, natural history survey had its particular period and life cycle. It arose out of a particular set of environmental, cultural, and scientific circumstances; ran its course; then gave way to new and different ways of studying nature's diversity. It was especially well developed in the United States, though not exclusively there.
My aim is to describe what natural history survey was in its heyday, the reasons it fourished where it did, and how it worked in practice.

该历史的另一个局限性在于，它主要处理脊椎动物学和一些植物学，但是几乎不涉及昆虫和其他无脊椎动物。这不是一个任意的限制：在我这一时期，尤其是在博物馆中进行的调查收集主要集中在脊椎动物上，因为科学实地考察work积在收集脊椎动物的展品上（昆虫，植物和软体动物的视力并不完全相同）此外，无脊椎动物的数量不多，无法进行全面的调查清单。在脊椎动物成为有组织的调查对象之后很长一段时间，它们仍然是业余专家的行列。无脊椎动物最近已成为系统清点的对象，但其方式与早期调查大不相同。

像任何科学（或任何文化）实践一样，自然历史调查也有其特定的时期和生命周期。它源于一组特定的环境，文化和科学环境；顺其自然；然后让路给研究自然多样性的新的和不同的方式。它在美国特别发达，尽管不仅仅在美国。我的目的是描述自然历史调查处于鼎盛时期的原因，它在何处发生的原因以及它在实践中的工作方式。

## Chapter 2

**Robots（机器人）**

Robors in Home: As their price falls, and their performance and computational ability rises.
making them both affordable and sufficiently autonomous, robots are increasingly being seen in the home where they are taking on simple but unwanted jobs, such as vacuum cleaning, floor cleaning and lawn mowing. While they have been on the market for several years, 2006 saw a great increase in the number of domestic robots sold. By 2006, iRobot had sold more thar two million vacuuming robots. They tend to be relatively autonomous, usually only requiring a command to begin their job. They then proceed to go about their business in their own way. At such, they display a good deal of agency, and are considered intelligent robots.

Telerobots: When a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible, teleoperated robots, or telerobots are used. Rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements a telerobot is controlled from a distance by a human operator. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. A laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time. An interesting use of a telerobot is by the author Margaret Atwood, who has recently started using a robot pen to sign books remotely. At the other end of the spectrum, iRobot ConnectR robot is designed to be used by anyone to stay in touch with family or friends from far away. Still another robot is being used by doctors to communicate with patients, allowing the doctor to be anywhere in the world. This increases the number of patients a doctor can monitor.

在家中的强盗：随着价格下降，性能和计算能力提高。机器人不仅价格合理，而且具有足够的自主性，因此越来越多的机器人在家里从事简单但不需要的工作，例如真空吸尘，地板清洁和割草。尽管它们已经投放市场了几年，但2006年家用机器人的销售数量却大大增加了。到2006年，iRobot已售出了超过200万台吸尘机器人。他们倾向于相对自治，通常只需要一个命令即可开始工作。然后，他们继续以自己的方式开展业务。在这种情况下，它们表现出很大的代理能力，被认为是智能机器人。

远程机器人：当由于危险，距离遥远或无法进入而无法在现场有人来执行工作时，将使用远程操作机器人或远程机器人。遥控机器人不是按照预定的运动顺序，而是由操作员从远处控制。机器人可能在另一个房间或另一个国家，或者与操作员的比例可能非常不同。与开放式手术相比，腹腔镜手术机器人可使外科医生在人类患者体内进行较小规模的工作，从而大大缩短了恢复时间。作家玛格丽特·阿特伍德（Margaret Atwood）是远程机器人的一种有趣用法，他最近开始使用机器人笔对书进行远程签名。另一方面，iRobot ConnectR机器人旨在供任何人用来与远方的家人或朋友保持联系。医生还使用另一个机器人与患者交流，从而使医生可以在世界任何地方。这增加了医生可以监控的患者数量。

## Chapter 3 

**Dark Energy（暗能量）**

Astronomers know dark matter is there by its gravitational effect on the matter that we sce and there are ideas about the kinds of particles it must be made of. By contrast, dark energy remains a complete mystery. The name "dark energy" refers to the fact that some kind of "stuff" must fill the vast reaches of mostly empty space in the Universe in order to be able to make space accelerate in its expansion. In this sense, it is a "field" just like an electric field or
a magnetic field, both of which are produced by electromagnetic energy. But this analogy car only be taken so far because we can readily observe electromagnetic energy via the particle that carries it, the photon.

Some astronomers identify dark energy with Einstein's Cosmological Constant. Einstein introduced this constant into his general relativity when he saw that his theory was predicting an expanding universe, which was contrary to the evidence for a static universe that he and other physicists had in the early 20th century. This constant balanced the expansion and made the universe static. With Edwin Hubble's discovery of the expansion of the Universe, Einstein dismissed his constant. It later became identified with what quantum theory calls the cnergy of the vacuum.

In the context of dark energy, the cosmological constant is a reservoir which stores energy, Its energy scales as the universe expands. Applied to the supernova data, it would distinguish effects due to the matter in the universe from those due to the dark energy. Unfortunately, the anount of this stored energy required is far more than observed, and would result in very rapid acceleration (so much so that the stars and galaxies would not form). Physicists have suggested a new type of matter, "quintessence", which would fill the universe like a fluid which has a negative gravitational mass. However, new constraints imposed on cosmological parameters by Hubble Space Telescope data rule out at least simple models of quintessence.

天文学家知道暗物质存在于我们所选择的物质上，因为它具有引力作用，并且对暗物质必须制成的种类有一些想法。相比之下，暗能量仍然是一个完全的谜。所谓“暗能量”，是指某种“物质”必须填充宇宙中大部分为空的空间，以使空间加速膨胀。从这个意义上讲，这是一个“场”，就像电场或磁场一样，两者都是由电磁能产生的。但是，这种类比汽车只能走那么远，因为我们可以很容易地通过携带它的粒子（光子）观察电磁能。

一些天文学家用爱因斯坦的宇宙常数确定暗能量。当爱因斯坦看到他的理论正在预言宇宙正在膨胀时，便将该常数引入了他的广义相对论中，这与他和其他物理学家在20世纪初所拥有的静态宇宙的证据相反。这个常数平衡了膨胀并使宇宙静止。随着埃德温·哈勃（Edwin Hubble）发现宇宙膨胀，爱因斯坦不顾其常数。后来，它被量子理论称为真空能的能量所识别。

在暗能量的背景下，宇宙常数是一个存储能量的储层，其能量随着宇宙的膨胀而缩放。应用于超新星数据，它将区分宇宙中物质与暗能量所产生的影响。不幸的是，这种存储能量的需求远远超过了观测到的能量，并且会导致非常迅速的加速（以至于恒星和星系不会形成）。物理学家提出了一种新的物质“精髓”，它将像具有负重力质量的流体一样充满宇宙。然而，哈勃太空望远镜数据对宇宙学参数施加的新约束至少排除了典型的简单模型。

## Chapter 4 

**Space and Time（空间与时间）**

Entropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that "picks" a particular direction for time, sometimes called an arrow of time. As one goes "forward" in time, the second law of thermodynamics says that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase or remain the same; it cannot decrease. Hence, from one perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a kind of clock.

The thermodynamic arrow is often linked to the cosmological arrow of time, because it is ultimately about the boundary conditions of the early universe. According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe was initially very hot with energy distributed uniformly. For a system in which gravity is important, such as the universe, this is a low-entropy state (compared to a highentropy state of having all matter collapsed into black holes, a state to which the system may eventually evolve). As the Universe grows, its temperature drops, which leaves less energy available to perform useful work in the future than was available in the past. Additionally, perturbations in the energy density grow (eventually forming galaxies and stars). Thus the Universe itself has a well-defined thermodynamic time. But this doesn't address the question of why the initial state of the universe was that of low entropy. If cosmic expansion were to halt and reverse due to gravity, the temperature of the Universe would once again increase, but its entropy would continue to increase due to the continued growth of perturbations and eventually black hole formation.

熵是物理学中唯一能“拾取”特定时间方向的量，有时也称为时间箭头。随着时间的推移，热力学第二定律说，一个孤立的系统的熵只能增加或保持不变。它不能减少。因此，从一个角度来看，熵测量被认为是一种时钟。

热力学箭头通常与时间的宇宙箭头联系在一起，因为它最终与早期宇宙的边界条件有关。根据大爆炸理论，宇宙最初非常热，能量均匀分布。对于其中重力很重要的系统（例如宇宙），这是低熵状态（与所有物质都坍塌成黑洞的高熵状态相比，该系统最终可能演化为该状态）。随着宇宙的成长，它的温度下降，与过去相比，未来可用于执行有用工作的能源更少。此外，能量密度的扰动会增加（最终形成星系和恒星）。因此，宇宙本身具有明确的热力学时间。但这并没有解决为什么宇宙的初始状态是低熵的问题。如果宇宙的膨胀由于重力而停止和逆转，那么宇宙的温度将再次升高，但是由于扰动的持续增长并最终形成黑洞，其熵将继续增加。

## Chapter 5 

**Computer Technology（计算机技术）**

Often the technologies that reshape daily life sneak up on us, until suddenly one day it's hard to imagine a world without them-instant messaging, for example, or microwave ovens Other watershed technologies are visible a mile away, and when you contemplate their applications, the ultimate social impact looks enormous. A good example of the latter is radio frequency identification chips-RFID, for short.

An RFID chip is a tiny bit of silicon, smaller than a grain of rice, that carries informationanything from a retail price, to cooking instructions, to your complete medical records. A larger piece of equipment called an RFID "reader" can, without direct contact, pull that information off the chip and in turn deliver it to any electronic device-a cash register, a video screen, a home appliance, even directly onto the Internet. RFID is the technology used now to automate tol taking at bridges and tunnels; drivers are given a small plastic box with an RFID chip inside allowing them to drive through the tollgates without stopping. An RFID reader in the tollbooth senses the information on the chip and the toll is automatically deducted from the driver's account.

The first wide-scale applications of RFID will be in retail. At a major industry conference next week, Wal-Mart is expected to urge its suppliers to adopt RFID-the same way that, 20 years ago, the giant retailer jump-started the use of bar codes. And some manufacturers are already on board. Gillette, for example, recently placed an order for half a billion RFID chips that they will begin to use to track individual packages of razors.

重塑日常生活的技术通常会悄悄溜走，直到突然有一天，很难想象没有这些技术的世界，例如即时消息传递或微波炉，一英里之外就可以看到其他分水岭技术，当您考虑它们的应用时，最终的社会影响看起来巨大。
简而言之，射频识别芯片就是一个很好的例子。

RFID芯片是一小块硅，比米粒小，它可以承载从零售价到烹饪说明到完整医疗记录的所有信息。称为RFID“读取器”的较大设备可以直接将信息从芯片中拉出，然后将其传送到任何电子设备，包括收银机，视频屏幕，家用电器，甚至直接传送到Internet。 RFID是目前用于自动化桥梁和隧道取水的技术。为驾驶员提供了一个装有RFID芯片的小塑料盒，使他们可以不停地驶过收费站。收费站中的RFID阅读器会感应到芯片上的信息，并会从驾驶员的帐户中自动扣除费用。

RFID的首批大规模应用将在零售领域。在下周的一次大型行业会议上，沃尔玛有望敦促其供应商采用RFID，就像20年前，这家大型零售商开始使用条形码一样。而且一些制造商已经加入。例如，吉列（Gillette）最近订购了半数RFID芯片，这些芯片将用于追踪单个剃刀包装。

## Chapter 6

**Mathernatics and Creativity（数学与独创性）**

Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences". In the original Latin Regina Scientiarum, as well as in German Königin der Wissenschaften, the word corresponding to science means (field of) knowledge. Indeed, this is also the original meaning in English, and there is no doubt that mathematics is in this sense a science. The specialization restricting the meaning to natural science is of later date. If one considers science to be strictly about the physical world, then mathematics, or at least pure mathematics, is not a science. Albert Einstein has stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain: and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.

Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and thus not a science according to the definition of Karl Popper. However, in the 1930s important work in mathematical logic showed that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypotheticodeductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently". Other thinkers, notably Imre Lakatos, have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself.

卡尔·弗里德里希·高斯（Carl Friedrich Gauss）将数学称为“科学女王”。在最初的拉丁语里贾纳科学和德国德语中，“科学”一词对应于科学（知识领域）。确实，这也是英语的原始含义，毫无疑问，从这个意义上讲，数学是一门科学。将含义限制在自然科学领域的专业化是后来的事。如果人们认为科学严格地是关于物理世界的，那么数学，或者至少是纯数学，就不是一门科学。阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（Albert Einstein）表示：“就数学定律而言，它们并不确定。而就其确定性而言，它们并不涉及现实。

许多哲学家认为，数学在实验上是不能伪造的，因此根据卡尔·波普尔的定义，它也不是一门科学。但是，在1930年代，数学逻辑方面的重要工作表明，数学不能归结为逻辑，卡尔·波普尔（Karl Popper）得出结论：“大多数数学理论都是假想归纳的，就像物理学和生物学的理论一样：纯数学因此变得更接近于数学。假设是猜想的自然科学，甚至比最近看起来还重要。”其他思想家，尤其是伊姆雷·拉卡托斯（Imre Lakatos），已经将一种证伪主义应用于数学本身。

**Natural History Surveys and Biodiversity（自然史调查与生物多样性）**

​																	生物多样性

生物多样性指在某一特定的生态系统内生活的不同物种的数量。科学家对现存物种数量的估计各不相同,从300万种到3,000万种不等,其中250万种已进行了分类,包括90万种昆虫41,000种脊椎动物, 25万种植物,其余是无脊椎动物、真菌类、藻类和微生物。尽管还有尚未发现的物种,然而许多物种由于滥伐森林、污染以及建立人类居住区而濒临灭绝。

生物多样性主要集中在热带地区,特别是林区。处于平衡状态的生境意味着现有物种的数量与资源处于平衡状态。生物多样性受到资源、繁殖力与气候的影响。某一生物多样性的生境越原始,就越能更好地承受自然或人类带来的变迁或威胁,因为这种变迁可以通过生境内其他地方的调整加以平衡,遭到破坏的生境可能由于某一单一物种的灭绝,造成食物链的断裂.而最终消逝。由此可见,生物多样性有助于防止物种的灭绝,保持自然平衡。1992年,在联合国环境与发展大会上, 150多个国家签署了保护地球生物多样性条约。

​																	Biodiversity

Biodiversity is a term that describes the number of different species that live within a particular ecosystem. Scientists have variously estimated that there are from 3 to 30 million extant species, of which 2.5 million have been classified including 900,000 insects, 41,000 vertebrates, and 250,000 plant; the remainder are invertebrates, fungi, algae, and microorganisms. Although other species remain to be discovered, many are becoming extinct through deforestation, pollution, and human settlement. 

Much of this diversity is found in the world's tropical areas, particularly in the forest regions. A habitat in equilibrium has a balance between the number of species present and its resources. Diversity is affected by resources, productivity, and climate. The more pristine a diverse habitat, the better chance it has to survive a change or threat--either natural or human-because that change can be balanced by an adjustment elsewhere in the community; damaged habitats may be destroyed by breaking the food chain with removal of a single species. Thus, biological diversity helps prevent extinction of species and helps preserve the balance of nature. At the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, more than 150 nations signed a treaty intended to protect the planet's biological diversity.

## Chapter 2

**Robots（机器人）**

​																		机器人

究竟什么是机器人,其定义多种多样,因此往往很难比较不同国家所拥有的机器人的数量。为了提供一个普遍接受的定义,国际标准化组织在其ISO 8373中将机器人定义为:"可自动控制、重复编程的、多种用途操作器,该操作器的编程可在三个或三个以上坐标轴上进行,既可以固定在某个地方,也可移动,用于工业自动化领域。”

除了国际标准化组织的定义以外,美国、日本等国家也有不同的定义。例如日本机器人的种类很多,因为在那里许多机器都被看作机器人。

由于没有哪一个定义能够使大家都满意,因此许多人都有他们自己的定义。例如,工业用机器人的开拓者Joseph Engelberger曾说:“我虽然不会给机器人下定义,但我一眼就能看出哪一个是机器人。'

做那些需要速度、精确度、可靠性或忍耐性的工作,机器人远远超过人类,因此在工厂里许多曾经由人做的工作现在都已自动化了,从而使人们能够大批量生产价格低廉的产品,如汽车和电子产品等。自从人们最初使用Unimate机器人将高温金属自动从压铸机中取出以来,机器人在工厂中的使用至今已有50年,而且其数量的增长越来越快,目前全世界有100多万台机器人在运转。

---

​																		Robots

There are many variations in definitions of what exactly is a robot. Therefore it is sometimes difficult to compare numbers of robots in different countries. To try to provide a universally acceptable definition, the International Organization for Standardization gives a definition of robot in ISO 8373, which defines a robot as "an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications.

In spite of the ISO definition, countries, such as the US and Japan have different definitions of robots. Japan, for example, lists very many robots partly because more machines are counted as robots. 

There is no one definition of robot which satisfies everyone, and many people have their own. For example, Joseph Engelberger, a pioneer in industrial robotics. once remarked:"I can't define a robot, but I know one when I see one.”

Jobs which require speed, accuracy, reliability or endurance can be performed far better by a robot than a human. Hence many jobs in factories which were traditionally performed by people are now robotized. This has led to cheaper mass-produced goods, including automobiles and electronics. Robots have now been working in factories for more than fifty years, ever since the Unimate robot was installed to automatically remove hot metal from a die casting machine. The number of installed robots has grown faster and faster, and today there are more than one million robots in operation worldwide.

## Chapter 3 

**Dark Energy（暗能量）**

​																		暗物质

在物理学和宇宙学中,暗物质指的是一种假想的物质,它与电磁力不发生相互作用,但从万有引力对可见物质的影响可以推断它的存在。根据大爆炸宇宙学,以及目前对那些大于星系的结构体的观测,在可观察的宇宙空间,绝大部分物质都是由暗物质和暗能量组成的。迄今人们观察到了星系的旋转速度,星系在星系团中的轨道运行速度,星系团(如“子弹星系团")附近背景物体的引力透镜效应,以及星系和星系团中热气体的温度分布等现象,这些现象意味着暗物质的存在。暗物质不仅在结构形成和星系演化过程中起着关键作用,对宇宙微波背景辐射的各向异性也有着显著影响。所有这些观察结果都表明,星系、星系团乃至整个宇宙所拥有的物质远远超过与电磁辐射相互作用的物质:其余这部分就叫做“暗物质成分”.

暗物质成分的质量远远大于宇宙的“可见”成分。据估计,目前宇宙中普通重子和辐射的密度大约相当于每立方米一个氢原子,可以直接观察到的能量密度仅占总量的4%,人们认为大约22%的能量密度是由暗物质组成,而其余74%由暗能量构成,后者是一种更加奇特的成分,稀薄地分布在宇宙中。据称,某种很难观测到的重子物质是暗物质的构成部分,但也只是一小部分而已。确定暗物质这种不可见物质的性质是现代宇宙学和粒子物理学最重要的课题之一。

​																		Dark Matter

In physics and cosmology, dark matter is hypothetical matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic force, but whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter. According to present observations of structures larger than galaxies, as well as Big Bang cosmology, dark matter and dark energy account for the vast majority of the mass in the observable universe. The observed phenomena which imply the presence of dark matter include the rotational speeds of galaxies, orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing of background objects by alaxy clusters such as the Bullet cluster, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter also plays a central role in structure formation and galaxy evolution, and has measurable effects on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. All these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the universe as a whole contain far more matter than that which interacts with electromagnetic radiation:the remainder is called the"dark matter component”.

The dark matter component has much more mass than the"visible"component of the universe. At present, the density of ordinary baryons and radiation in the universe is estimated to be equivalent to about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter of space Only about 4% of the total energy density in the universe can be seen directly. About 22% is thought to be composed of dark matter. The remaining 74% is thought to consist of dark energy, an even stranger component, distributed diffusely in space Some hard-to-detect baryonic matter is believed to make a contribution to dark matter but would constitute only a small portion. Determining the nature of this missing mass is one of the most important problems in modern cosmology and particle physics.

## Chapter 4 

**Space and Time（空间与时间）**

​																		宇宙大爆炸

大爆炸理论从诞生以来就不断受到人们的置疑,从而促使那些相信该理论的人去寻找更多的证据,来证明他们是对的。在本书完成时,许多人又做了更进一步的研究,而且的确有了多项发现,使人们更加全面地了解宇宙的起源。

最近美国国家航空航天局就做出了令人惊讶的发现,为证明大爆炸理论提供了证据。其中最重要的发现是,天文学家利用Astro-2天文台证实了字宙通过大爆炸诞生的必要条件之一。
1995年6月,科学家在宇宙深处探测到原生氮(如重氢)的存在。这一发现与大爆炸理论的一个重要方面相符,即在宇宙诞生之初就产生了氢与氮的混合物。

此外,哈勃望远镜(该望远镜以大爆炸理论之父的名字命名)也对解答宇宙形成后出现了哪些元素这一问题提供了某些线索,天文学家通过哈勃望远镜在极为古老的恒星内发现了硼元素。他们推测硼有可能是星系形成时能量爆发的残留物,也可能表明硼比宇宙更古老,可以追溯到大爆炸发生的时候。如果后一种推测成立的话,科学家不得不再次修改有关宇宙形成以及随后发生了什么的理论,因为根据目前的理论,重量如此之大、结构如此复杂的原子当时是不可能存在的。

Since its conception, the theory of the Big Bang has been constantly challenged These challenges have led those who believe in the theory to search for more concrete evidence which would prove them correct. From the point at which this book leaves off, many have tried to go further and several discoveries have been made that paint a more complete picture of the creation of the universe. 

Recently, NASA has made some astounding discoveries which lend themselves to the proof of the Big Bang theory. Most importantly, astronomers using the Astro-2 observatory were able to confirm one of the requirements for the foundation of the universe through the Big Bang. In June, 1995, scientists were able to detect primordial helium, such as deuterium in the far reaches of the universe. These findings consistent with an important aspect of the Big Bang theory that a mixture of hydrogen and helium was created at the beginning of the universe. 

In addition, the Hubble telescope, named after the father of Big Bang theory, has provided certain clues as to what elements were present following creation. Astronomers using Hubble have found the element boron in extremely ancient stars. They postulate that its presence could be either a remnant of energetic events at the birth of galaxies or it could indicate that boron is even older, dating back to the Big Bang itself. If the latter is true, scientists will be forced once again to modify their theory for the birth of the universe and events immediately afterward because, according to the present theory, such a heavy and complex atom could not have existed.

## Chapter 5 

**Computer Technology（计算机技术）**

​																	多点触控技术

多点触控指的是人机互动技术和应用该技术的硬件设施,利用这些设施,使用者不需要传统的输入设备(如鼠标、键盘)就可以进行运算。多点触控由触控式屏幕或触控垫,以及可以同时辨认多个触点的软件组成,它与标准的触摸屏不同,因为后者只能辨认一个触点。

多点触控技术始于1982年,当时多伦多大学首先研制出了指压多触点显示技术。同年,贝尔实验室发表了据信是将触摸屏技术用于接口装置的第一篇论文。21世纪初,该技术使各类公司得到发展, 2007年苹果公司推出了iPhone,微软展示了桌面计算技术。尤其是iPhone引起了人们对多点触控计算技术的广泛兴趣,因为该技术规模虽小,却大大增加了用户的互动。随之出现了更强大的、可为用户量身定制的多点触控设备,例如Perceptive Pixel公司研制的壁式显示屏和台式设备可以允许20个手指同时操作。

预计多点触控技术会很快得到普遍应用。例如多点触控电话将从2006年出售的20万台增至2012年的2,100万台。事实上,开发商已提出应用多点触控技术的多种方法。

​																Multi-touch Technology

Multi-touch is a human-computer interaction technique and the hardware devices that implement it, which allow users to compute without conventional input devices such as mouse and keyboard. Multi-touch consists of a touch screen or touchpad, as well as software that recognizes multiple simultaneous touch points, as opposed to the standard touchscreen, which recognizes only one touch point.

Multi-touch technology dates back to 1982， when the University of Toronto developed the first finger pressure multi-touch display. The same year, Bell Labs published what is believed to be the first paper discussing touch-screen based interfaces. Various companies expanded upon the development of this technology at the beginning of the 21st century. In 2007, Apple unveiled the iPhone and Microsoft debuted surface computing. The iPhone in particular has spawned a wave of interest in multi-touch computing, since it permits greatly increased user interaction on a small scale. More robust and customizable multi-touch solutions are beginning to become available. For example, the wall displays and tables developed by Perceptive Pixel can accommodate up to 20 fingers.

The use of multi-touch technology is expected to rapidly become common place For example, touch screen telephones are expected to increase from 200， 000 shipped in 2006 to 21 million in 2012. In fact, developers of the technology have suggested a variety of ways that multi-touch can be used.

## Chapter 6

**Mathernatics and Creativity（数学与独创性）**

​															世界是数学的一面镜子

伽利略在1623年发表的《试金者》 (Assayer)中对数学的批评性评论从根本上给予了答复,他写道: “宇宙是由数学的语言写成的。”伽利略所表达的也是当时学者广泛持有的观点,即数学远远不像批评者所说的那样不具有任何实质性内容,相反,数学的研究目的就是整个自然界。然而,虽然大多数人认为数学与物质世界密切相关,但这种关系的性质仍然是激烈争论的焦点。

其中一种主要的看法与传统观点一致,即数学是表示数字和数量的一门严密推理性学科。根据这种观点,数学的普遍定律是制约物质现实的基本定律。因此,人们研究数学和几何学的关系时,实际上研究的是物质的基本结构。

这种观点的主要倡导者是勒奈·笛卡尔(René Descartes),他将数学看作是上帝为了创造宇宙而制定的基本的、推理性的定律。当神圣的建筑师--上帝-使完全理性化的宇宙开始运转,它就会根据数学原理永远运转下去。因此,数学研究是按照神的旨意对自然界的研究而世界则是抽象的数学原理的直接表达。

​												The World as Mirror of Mathematics

The fundamental answer to the critiques of mathematics was given by Galileo in his Assayer of 1623, when he wrote that the universe"is written in the language of mathematics. "Galileo was expressing the widely held notion among practitioners that mathematics, far from being devoid of all subject matter as claimed by its critics, had the entire natural world as its object. But while most agreed that mathematics was closely integrated with the physical world, the precise nature of their relationship remained a matter of intense dispute. 

One leading approach accepted the classical view of mathematics as a rigorous deductive science of number and magnitude. The universal laws of mathematics, in this view, were the fundamental laws that governed material reality. Thus when one is investigating mathematical and geometrical relationships, one is in fact investigating the basic structure of matter. 

The chief promoter of this approach was Rene Descartes, who viewed mathematics as a fundamental rational law laid down by God for his creation. Once God, the divine architect, had set in motion his perfectly rational universe, it would henceforth operate forever in accordance with mathematical principles. Mathematical investigations are accordingly studies of the divine plan for the natural world, and the world is the direct expression of abstract mathematical principles.
